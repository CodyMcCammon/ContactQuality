# ContactQuality
A physics-based approach to representing quality of contact at the moment of impact.

This project seeks to find weaknesses/strengths in hitter/pitcher approach (attack angle, timing, spin, force, etc.) to determine the quality of contact for each pitch. From this data, trends can be found in each player's approach with the express intent of maximizing contact quality (for hitters) or minimize contact quality (for pitchers).
